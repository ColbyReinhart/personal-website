	<h2>About me</h2>
	<img src="/static/media/about_me_picture.jpg" />
	<p>
		My name is Colby Reinhart. I became a software developer because I have always been a creator
		and I adore the infinite possibilities that computers afford us. The privilege of being able to
		use my skills as a creator to develop software that is meaningful, beneficial, and useful
		to people around the world is what drives me to improve and continue at any chance I get.
		I am also a team player and enjoy working with others who share my vision and appreciation for
		the projects I work on. At every step in my career I focus on quality, maintainability, and
		efficiency in my work. Regardless of the challenge I am eager to prove myself and assert my
		skills as a valuable member of any team. 
	</p>
	<p>
		These qualities I possess also carry over to my many personal projects. When my mind is not
		focused on my work, it is likely imagining project ideas of various scales and complexities.
		Although not every projects makes it out of my imagination, I do my best to leverage these
		creative sparks as an opportunity to hone my skills and dive into new ideas and technologies.
		My hope is that my career and side projects can mutually benefit each other such that my
		experiences in the workplace widen my perspectives and my skills learned from side projects
		can improve my workplace productivity.
	</p>
	<p>
		The significance I assign to my career does not undermine my personal life, however. When I am
		not exercising my skills as I creator I am spending time with friends, maintaining my physical
		fitness or enjoying a pass time such as a video game or TV show. I greatly value the people who
		share their time with me and I them. Likewise, being physically fit is an important aspect of me
		which allows me to channel my emotions, improve my discipline and preserve my health. Although
		I don't have as much time for video games as I once did, I admire them as a pass time, an art
		form, and a feat of software engineering.
